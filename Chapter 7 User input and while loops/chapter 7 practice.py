The confusing part of above example to me is: while unconfirmed_users:
try bool([]), we can see it returns a false. The empty list bool value is false,
so when the list is not empty yet, the while loop continues. to get it easier:

while len(unconfirmed_users) != 0:
    current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop()
    confirmed_users.append(current_user)

it means when the uncofirmed users list is not empty yet, while loop continues
