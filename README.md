Python crush course 3rd edition Try it yourself solutions

This is a my own work for Python Crush Course 3rd edition, an introductory programming book from No Starch Press by Eric Matthes, ISBN-13: 978-1718502703. I would like to share them with all other learners, to discuss, and grow together.

In each chapter, the Tryityourself.py is the solutions to the try it yourself sessions in the book, and the practice.py is the summary and examples of the knowledge.
